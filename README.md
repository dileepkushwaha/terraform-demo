# Terraform basics
Terraform sources their providers and modules from the Terraform registry which is located ar [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io)

- **Providers** are interfaces that allow you to create resources through terraform
- **Modules** are a way to make large terraform code to become modular and sharable.
